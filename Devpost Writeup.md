# Devpost Writeup

# Inspiration
People think rashly and make bad decisions when their emotions take the best of them, and they are in the “heat of the moment.” Many times, this leads to people venting out by posting controversial stuff on social media. Our team saw the implications controversial posts had and the damage it was causing. People were getting fired from their jobs, getting rescinded from colleges, losing sponsorships etc. By no means did we agree with the message behind these posts, but we knew that if people had known the repercussions behind such posts, they certainly would not have posted.

With social media playing a large part in our society, there is little monitoring done on any of the major social media platforms to make sure that one does not make a bad decision regarding a post. Our team wanted to fix this.


# What it does

To solve this issue, our team created PreTweet. When someone is the “heat of the moment” or if someone is unsure about a Tweet they are about to post, we encourage them to come to our site. The user will enter their email address and type up the Tweet they plan to publish. But instead of posting the Tweet right away, our software will send the user an email 3 days later asking if they want to post the Tweet. The reason we chose 3 days is that by this point, we hope the user would have calmed down and hopefully they can make a better decision about their tweet. Our website also shows the user how negative or positive their Tweet is. If the user **does not** want the tweet to post they do not have to do anything. If the user **does** wants to post the tweet, they can come to our website to do so. If the user is still unsure about whether they want to post their Tweet or not, our site also offers the ability for the Tweet to be sent to a professional for review.

# What's next for PreTweet
We want to help people make the right decisions on what they post to ANY social media platform. So, in the future, we plan to expand PreTweet to Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc.
